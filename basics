adding user -> useradd suman
adding group -> groupadd devops
verifying user -> grep suman /etc/passwd or id -a suman
verifying group -> grep devops /etc/group
adding user to multiple groups -> gpasswd -a suman azure, here 1st you need to create group azure by groupadd azure
he is already part of devops group now he became a member of azure also
modifing the user to be part of another group by removing from current group -> usermod suman -g devops



for creating folder inside a folder -> mkdir -p /tmp/f1/f2/f3/f4
for checking conent -> ls -l /tmp/f1/f2/f3/f4
for checking information -> ls -ld /tmp/f1/f2/f3/f4

for copying files from 1 folder to another
mkdir /tmp/src
mkdir /tmp/dest
ls -ld /tmp/src , ls -l /tmp/src
ls -ld /tmp/dest , ls -l /tmp/dest

touch /tmp/src/file{1..5}.txt
ls -l /tmp/src
cp /tmp/src/file2.txt /tmp/dest
ls -l /tmp/dest   -> file2 is avail in both src and dest folders
cp /tmp/src/file* /tmp/dest  -> for copying all the files


for moving files from 1 folder to another folder
mv /tmp/src/file2.txt /tmp/dest
verify -> ls -l /tmp/src -> file2.txt absent
ls -l /tmp/dest -> file2.txt present


for removing files in a folder  -> 2 ways 
cd /tmp/dest
pwd
rm -rf file2.txt
or
rm -rf /tmp/dest/file2.txt 
verify after deletion

for changing the ownership of the folder
chown suman:devops /tmp/src 
here you need to create user and group 1st 
for changing ownership and applying the ownership to files inside folder
chown suman:devops /tmp/src -R


for changing permissions at folder level 
ls -l /tmp/src
chmod 777 /tmp/src -> applied only at folder level
for applying the permission change to files also
chmod 777 /tmp/src -R


for identifing the location or where the file exists
touch mysore.txt
touch MYSORE.TXT

find / -iname mysore.txt -> will display both the files
find / -name mysore.txt -> will display only mysore.txt
find / -name MYSORE.TXT -> will display only MYSORE.TXT
i stands for ignoring the case sensitivity


for hiding the files 

adding . in front of file makes it hidden and giving la will make us to see hidden files
touch /tmp/.rcb.txt
ls -l /tmp/  -> rcb.txt not reflected 
ls -la /tmp/ -> rcb.txt reflected

for deleting the hidden files 
rm -rf /tmp/.rcb.txt

more cars.txt -> space to get content in page wise, enter to get in line wise


----> vi editors
i = insert mode
esc = esc mode
gg = start of page
shift+g = end of page
0 =  start of line
shift+$ = end of line
: set nu = content with line number
y2y =  copying, 2 specifies no of lines 
p = pasting the content 
d9d =  deleting the content , 9 specifies no of lines
u = undo 
cnt+r = redo
# at start of line = will make it as commented line
for replcing a word -> :%s/contessa/cambry/g  , contessa is existing word and cambry is the word of replacement and g is global

you should take the backup of the file you are edting for safety 
cp cars.txt cars.txt-1-2-3
in case any issues with cars.txt and you are not able to restore changes then do copy from backup to it like
cp cars.txt-1-2-3 cars.txt
now both cars.txt and cars.txt-1-2-3 will be having content
