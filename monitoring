if any one saying app is down or lazy loading 
take domain name,lbcr,target group,ec2,health check
login to server -> install apache
netstat -nap|grep :80 -> in place of 80 can given exposed port no, it should be in listening state
ps -ef -> gives all the list ofg process running 
ps -ef|grep -i PID , which was given by netstat -nap|grep :80 -> by this we wil come to know who is consuming the port
every process will have its own PID
free -g, free -m -> shows you free space in storage via gb and mb size
top command -> like task manager will tell us who is consuming what mem and cpu -> shift+m , shift+p
once you get to know about PID you inform about that PID to app team and tell me to handle the situation an restart the app if they are asking us to kill take official mail and delete 
else you have to loose your job 
kill -9 PID
cat /proc/meminfo -> gives system mem info
cat /proc/cpuinfo -> gives system cpu ifo
vmstat 2 3 -> 2 rep seconds and 3 rep itterations
cat /etc/login.defs -> userid you can give
in case if every thing is fine and still facing issue the increase the ipos of disk attached via console -> iostat /dev/diskname it should be in idle state
